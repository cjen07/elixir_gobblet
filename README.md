## gobblet
gobblet game in elixir, phoenix and elm

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Install Elm dependencies with `cd assets/elm && `[`elm_install`](https://github.com/gdotdesign/elm-github-install)
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

### remark
* this repo is highly encouraged by this [repo](https://github.com/ventsislaf/talks).
* I fixed two bugs and updated for elixir v1.4 using Registry: [repo](https://github.com/cjen07/from_tictactoe_to_gobblet).
* it is tictactoe with phoenix v1.3 and elm before I add logics of gobblet.
